  "full_cover_letter": "My name is <strong>Mart√≠n Ruiz</strong>, and I am a <strong>Graphic Design graduate</strong> who took an unconventional yet rewarding path into web development. After a year working in design, I decided to explore a career that offered not just <strong>financial growth</strong> but also a new <strong>technical challenge</strong>. That decision led me to web development, starting with Adobe Muse‚Äîa drag-and-drop tool for creating websites (now discontinued). At first, I was intimidated by screens filled with code, but a critical turning point changed everything.\n\nI encountered a project requirement that Adobe Muse couldn‚Äôt handle. Determined to find a solution, I stayed at the office all night, attempting to solve it. Though I didn‚Äôt succeed that time, the experience inspired me to dive headfirst into web development. <strong>I began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,</strong> and quickly fell in love with the creative and technical possibilities coding offered. Over time, I expanded my expertise to encompass the full process of building and deploying websites, including VPS management, SSH connections, and CI/CD pipelines.\n\nNow, with <strong>seven years of experience</strong> as a web developer, I have built a strong foundation in modern web technologies. For over five of those years, <strong>I‚Äôve specialized in Vue.js</strong>, my favorite JavaScript framework. I especially enjoy leveraging the flexibility of Nuxt to create scalable and performant applications.\n\nIn addition to my technical expertise, I have developed a knack for identifying and fixing issues. While it may not be the most glamorous part of the job, <strong>I‚Äôve become an adept bug hunter‚Äîa</strong> skill that requires persistence, attention to detail, and the ability to think critically under pressure. It‚Äôs not something I take pride in, but I recognize its importance and have become exceptionally good at it.\n\nI‚Äôm passionate about delivering clean, maintainable code and creating seamless user experiences. I would be thrilled to bring my skills and enthusiasm to new teams, contributing to innovative projects and continuing to grow as a developer.",
